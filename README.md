# Random-Forest-Implementation using sklearn
•	I am using sklearn library for Random Forest Classification
•	The first step is to read the TrainingSet file and Testdata file. For this purpose I used pandas library
•	Next step is to apply RandomForest Classification on training data using 100 random forest. 
•	The trained model is applied on test data and results are stored on the output file
•	Similarly the training data is trained for 300 and 500 random forests and is applied on test data
•	It can be seen from the results that all the random forests produce same results
